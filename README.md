# Grokking Cliffs: Label-Noise Rate, Weight Decay, and the Scarcity Dissociation

A controlled study of how label-noise rate, weight-decay strength, and training-data scarcity each modulate **grokking** (delayed generalization) on the modular-arithmetic task `(a + b) mod p`.

## What the data show

After 230 toy runs (1-layer transformer, 214K params, p=59) and 4 GPT-2-medium real-LM runs:

1. **Sharp grokking cliff in label-noise rate.** With weight decay in {0.3, 1.0}, 5/5 seeds grok at noise ≤ 0.10 and 0/5 seeds grok at noise ≥ 0.15. The transition occupies a single 5-percentage-point band.
2. **Weight decay is a second-axis cliff.** wd=3.0 prevents grokking entirely (the model cannot fit the clean training set); wd=0.3 and wd=1.0 grok up to a noise-cliff that *shifts slightly with wd*.
3. **Noise ≡ "model-collapse" contamination at matched rate.** At noise=0.15, random-label noise and temperature-warped collapse contamination produce statistically indistinguishable test-acc and Fourier-concentration distributions (n=5 each). The original "collapse is a distinct phenomenon" framing is **refuted by our own baseline**.
4. **Scarcity dissociation.** At 50% less training data, the model still groks and Fourier concentration is *higher* than at full data — while at 15% corrupted data it does not grok. This rules out "contamination = effective sample-size shrinkage" as the mechanism.

## Status (2026-05-10)

Toy phase: complete. Real-LM phase: in-flight (data-prep job died at SLURM time limit; resubmission queued). Mechanistic causal analysis: observational only — surgical-transplant rescue (Experiment A) is the next milestone. Threshold theory (Experiment C) has the empirical wd × noise grid; closed-form derivation pending.

See `AUDIT_CLAUDE.md` for the most recent independent on-disk audit and `NEXT_STAGE.md` for the week-by-week plan.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install (uv + venv, NOT conda — we are on Rivanna)
uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install torch numpy matplotlib scipy

# Single training run
python src/train.py --condition pure --max-steps 50000

# Reproduce the wd × noise grid (SLURM array, 90 jobs)
sbatch slurm/exp_c_grid.sbatch

# Reproduce the noise / scarcity / multi-seed baselines
sbatch slurm/baselines.sh

# Surgical transplant rescue (after Experiment A is run)
python src/transplant_rescue.py \
    --pure-run results/exp_c_grid/wd1/noise0/seed_42 \
    --contam-run results/exp_c_grid/wd1/noise0.15/seed_42 \
    --output-dir analysis/transplant
```

## Architecture

- 1-layer Transformer encoder, d_model=128, 4 heads, d_ff=512 (~214K params).
- Token + positional embeddings, GELU FFN, mean-pool over the two input positions, p-way output head.
- Default optimizer: AdamW, lr=1e-3, wd=1.0, batch=512, 50000 steps.
- Default task: `(a+b) mod 59` with 30% train fraction.

## Experiment Design & Key Findings

This project explores how synthetic data contamination (model collapse) influences the grokking phenomenon in small transformers trained on modular arithmetic tasks.

### Key Findings
1. **Grokking Onset:** Pure data triggers grokking at approximately step 1400.
2. **Delayed Grokking:** Low collapse (5%) delays grokking significantly (e.g., to step 3100).
3. **Prevention of Grokking:** Moderate to severe collapse (15%+) completely prevents grokking, confirming that the loss of long-tail data points fundamentally disrupts the sparse feature discovery required for late-stage generalization.
4. **Weight Norm Correlation:** A sharp 30-42% reduction in weight norm is highly correlated with model collapse severity.
5. **Attention Disruptions:** As evidenced by attention entropy plots, collapse restricts the formation of crisp, specialized attention heads, leaving attention weights highly entropic and unspecialized.

### Reproduction Instructions
- **Setup:** Run `uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` followed by `uv pip install torch numpy matplotlib scipy seaborn pandas`.
- **Training:** Execute `python src/train.py --all` to run the suite of collapse levels (pure, low, medium, high, severe).
- **Analysis:** Run `python src/analysis/comprehensive_analysis.py` to generate loss/accuracy and weight norm graphs across the runs.
- **Attention Visualization:** Run `python src/viz/attention/visualize_attention.py` to plot attention heatmaps and entropy graphs.

### Interpretation Guide
- **Grokking Indicator:** Test accuracy remaining low until a sudden, rapid jump to >95%, coupled with a drop in test loss.
- **Attention Entropy:** High entropy implies diffuse, unspecialized attention. Grokking generally pairs with a drop in entropy for specific heads as they specialize in tracking modular operands.
- **Fourier Concentration:** A concentrated Fourier spectrum indicates the embeddings are structuring themselves correctly on the circle required for modular arithmetic.
